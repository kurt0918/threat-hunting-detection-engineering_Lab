# Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering – Portfolio

Welcome to my Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering lab.

I specialize in:
- Threat hunting across Microsoft Sentinel, Defender, Splunk, and EDR platforms
- Translating CTI (actors, campaigns, and TTPs) into actionable detections
- Building hunt playbooks, detection specs, and automation for SOCs and MSSPs

## Featured Work

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Hunt (Microsoft Sentinel)

- **Goal:** Identify potential PowerShell abuse (LOLBins, encoded commands)
- **Tech:** KQL, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Sentinel
- **Artifacts:**
  - Hunt notebook
  - KQL query
  - Detection specification

### 2. Ransomware Kill Chain Detection (Splunk + EDR)

- **Goal:** Detect ransomware behaviors before encryption
- **Focus:** Lateral movement, shadow copy deletion, persistence
- **Artifacts:** SPL searches, ATT&CK mapping, response playbook

### 3. CTI-Driven Supply Chain Intrusion Hunt

- **Goal:** Turn a real-world campaign into data-driven hunts
- **Focus:** Mapping TTPs to log sources and detections
- **Artifacts:** Actor profile, hunt notebook, detection rules
