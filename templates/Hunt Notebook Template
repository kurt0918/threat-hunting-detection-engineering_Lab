- **Primary Tools:** (Sentinel, Splunk, Defender, SentinelOne, etc.)

## 2. Trigger & Hypothesis

- **Trigger:**  
  (CTI report, anomalous alerts, detection gap, purple-team exercise, etc.)

- **Hypothesis:**  
  If <actor/TTP/behavior> is present in the environment, we should see <signals/artifacts> in <data sources>.

## 3. Scope & Data Sources

- **Time Range:** 
- **Log Sources:**
  - e.g., `SecurityEvent`, `DeviceProcessEvents`, proxy logs, DNS logs
- **Key Fields:**
  - e.g., `AccountName`, `ProcessCommandLine`, `IPAddress`, `DeviceName`
